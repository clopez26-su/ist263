    <h1>Ciane Lopez</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Ciane Lopez. 

I am currently a third-year student at Syracuse University studying Public Relations with minors in Information Management and Technology and Policy Studies. I am looking to work for a Public Relations agency or in-house at a prominent travel, entertainment, or fashion and beauty company. Below are some of my notable skills and accomplishments from my previous experiences: 
-Planned, created, and scheduled social media content across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube
-Managed monthly content calendars for 7+ clients, producing graphics and video using Canva, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro
-Coordinated and executed media days to produce high-performing digital content
-Created press releases, PESO models, and SWOT analyses to support client communication and branding efforts
-Developed branded content partnerships with Edikted, Poppi, Celsius, and SOREL Boots
-Certifications: MuckRack Media Relations, Brandwatch Consumer Research Foundations, Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint, Word)
-Technical Skills: AP Style, Social Media Management, Content Creation, Media Relations, Brand Strategy
-Languages: Bilingual — English & Spanish

Besides my career and studies, some more about me is that I am from Southern New Jersey, and I am a passionate Eagles fan. In my free time, I enjoy being active by running or going to the gym, and I also love watching movies and reading. The Harry Potter series is a personal favorite of mine. Another big passion of mine is traveling. This past August to December, I did a semester abroad where I traveled to seven different countries around Europe. Some places I hope to go one day are Japan, Peru, Greece, and Egypt.
